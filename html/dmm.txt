Above, you see the date and time of when I probably last logged into my server. When my server detects a stale login, it sends this message.
Below, you see an automated message generated by the dead man's switch.

Hello,

This is an automated message generated by a dead man's switch from someone you may know. The tidings bode ill for the dead, who disappeared before fully configuring their switch. It happens and take heart, all is not lost ever, really.

So this much is true, a dead man's switch has been triggered due to inactivity.

Best,
The *deadman
