Hello,

This is an automated message generated by a dead man's switch from someone you may know. The tidings bode ill for the dead, who disappeared before fully configuring their switch. It happens and so, take heart, all is not lost ever, really.

So this much is true, a dead man's switch has been triggered due to inactivity. Who's was it?

Best,
The original deadman
